# Boxing-Coach
C# Desktop Application for personal use It includes two functions that I really needed for my personal trainings:
1.Routine timer, this is a custom timer, you can add the name of the excercise and the duration in seconds, and add it to a queue, this for the purpose of doing excercises changing rythm and intensity(again for personal use and until now I haven't fount an application that satisfies this need for my personal routines).
2.A combo random maker for punches, these are in spanish though, because that's my native language, I seariously doubt anyone but me will read this, but I write it just in case, this point refers to a combo maker in a way that when you're training it feels like someone else is training you dictating you combos that you don't expect.

If someone read this and you feel like touching yourself the code, it's very messy, and I know it's far from optimal, very very far it has a lot of repetitive code, and that has a reason, the reason is that I run out of time for making this proyect and I had to do it very quickly, but I wantened to finish it, I know how this code can be enhanced belive me, but again I thought this is for personal use so I'll leave it like this until I get a little more time to work on this, double check everything works fine, because I intend to use it daily and I prefer that it works with poor performance ratther than dealing with unexpected bugs. If you want me to update this proyect or have any doubts whatsoever feel free to contact me.
